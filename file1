Richard Stallman's Free Software Definition, adopted by the Free Software Foundation (FSF), defines free software as a matter of liberty,
not price.[17] The earliest known publication of the definition of his free software idea was in the February 1986 edition[18] of the FSF's now-discontinued GNU's Bulletin publication. The canonical source for the document 
is in the philosophy section of the GNU Project website. As of August 2017, it is published there in 40 languages.
